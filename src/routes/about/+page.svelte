			Hi, I’m Mary! I’m an acrylic and gouache painter based in Seattle, Washington. My art is
			inspired by the tiny details in everyday life that often go unnoticed, like the shadows of
			leaves on the sidewalk or the reflection of light on the surface of a lake. I use rich colors
			and intricate detail to create a hybrid between realism and surrealism. I take time out of
			every day to paint, and I’m so excited to share my world with you!
